# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Hey there! This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game I built in Java. You play against the computer right in the console. 

## How to Play

- When you run the program, it will ask you to enter your choice:
  - `r` for Rock
  - `p` for Paper
  - `s` for Scissors
- The computer will randomly pick one too.
- The game will tell you who won the round.
- You can keep playing as long as you want by pressing `y` when asked.
